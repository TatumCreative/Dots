#[EvolveJS](http://evolvejs.com/) - An Evolution Simulator

This is a project to demonstrate what's possible with some of the latest open web technologies (HTML5). This simulation is using both 2d canvas drawing and 3d WebGL rendering. The cells reproduce asexually and have a chance of mutating their phenotypical properties. Their behaviors are are driven by an artificial intelligence state machine. I would like it to eventually target an education audience as a way to express abstract evolution ideas in a tangible playful medium.
