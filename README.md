###An HTML5 Canvas Experiment with Artificial Intelligence and Swarming Behaviors

This is an experiment to play around with some newer browser features like `requestAnimationFrame` and `canvas`, as well as an opportunity to write some artificial intelligence code using a finite state machine.

#### The branches

#####Master
The master version has the start of an interface to change values. Eventually this will be fleshed out more. One issue I still need to fix is a memory leak of some kind in my grid graph. I'm debating going to a Quadtree on that graph though. [Check out the demo here](http://tatumcreative.github.io/Evo.js/master/).

#####3d
A 3d version of the project, forked earlier on, that works but not all of the behavior states have been implemented and debugged. It's still pretty though! [Check out the demo here](http://tatumcreative.github.io/Evo.js/3d/).
