#EvolveJS - An Evolution Simulator

This is a project to demonstrate what's possible with some of the latest HTML5 technologies. This simulation is using both 2d canvas drawing and 3d WebGL rendering. The cells reproduce asexually and have a chance of mutating their phenotypical properties. Their behaviors are are driven by an artificial intelligence state machine. I would like it to eventually target an education audience as a way to express abstract evolution ideas in a tangible playful medium.

## The branches

###Master Branch: 2d Drawing
The latest master version has the beginnings of an interface to change values to run different simulations. Eventually this will be fleshed out more. [Check out the demo here](http://evolvejs.com/).

###3d Branch: WebGL and Three.js
This is my current development branch I'm working on merging the two versions together. Not all of the behavior states have been implemented and debugged. [Check out the demo here](http://evolvejs.com/3d/).
